# Saadni 🤝

**Saadni** (Arabic for "Help Me") is a friendly, community-driven application that connects people who need a quick hand with locals who are ready to step in and help. 

Whether you are someone who needs an extra set of hands moving furniture, a busy parent looking for cleaning assistance, or a small local business needing someone to run a quick errand, Saadni makes finding help effortless. You can easily post a short job, set your own upfront budget, and broadcast it to your neighborhood.

On the flip side, anyone nearby looking to earn some extra cash can open the app, browse the integrated map, and find tasks that fit their schedule. Once they apply to take the task, both parties can chat directly within the app to work out the final details safely and efficiently. 

Ultimately, Saadni is the simplest way for the community to team up, get everyday tasks done quickly, and help each other earn some extra cash.
